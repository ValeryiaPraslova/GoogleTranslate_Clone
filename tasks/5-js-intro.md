1. Go to the `src\js` folder and learn about data types. You can use the [learn.javascript](https://learn.javascript.ru/) site to make it easier.
2. Open the `coverage\lcov-report\index.html` file by right-clicking on it and selecting `"Reveal in File Explorer"`. Then, open it by double-clicking. Your task is to improve the functions so that they pass the tests.
3. Run the command `npm run test` in the terminal to check how many tests have passed.
4. Once all tests pass, run npm run coverage to regenerate the `coverage\lcov-report\index.html` file. Then, follow step 2 again to verify that all cases are covered.
